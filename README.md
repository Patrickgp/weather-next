This project was designed for a traveler that wants to see the weather outlook for multiple cities so that they can plan a trip accordingly. The user is provided a weather dashboard with a form input requesting a city name. When the user searches for a city they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history. When the user views current weather conditions for that city they are provided with the city name, date, icon representation of weather conditions, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV Index. The UV Index display is designed to dynamically change in color indicating the risk level is low, moderate, high, or dangerous (key is provided below index display). The user is presented with a 5 day forecast displayed on 5 cards. They show the date, icon representation of weather conditions, temperature, wind speed, and humidity. The user is able to click on previous cities searched in the search history bar and will again be provided with current and future conditions for that city.
